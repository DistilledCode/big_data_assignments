      "    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n",

      "    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n",
      "    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n",
      "    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n",

      "A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n",
      "    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n",

      "    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n",
      "    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n",
      "    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n",
      "    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n",

      "A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n",
      "    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n",
      "    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n",

      "    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n",
      "    always wants to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n",
      "    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n",
      "    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n",
      "    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n",
      "    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n",
      "    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n",
      "    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n",
      "    or badly grooved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n",
      "    this really a good idea?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n",
      "    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n",
      "    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n",
      "    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n",
      "    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n",
      "    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n",
      "\n",
      "    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n",
      "    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n",
      "    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n",
      "    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n",
      "    car with an automatic to take the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n",
      "    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n",
      "    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n",
      "    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n",
      "    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n",
      "    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n",
      "    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n",
      "    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n",
      "    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n",
      "    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n",
      "    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n",
      "    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n",
      "    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n",
      "    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n",
      "    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n",
      "    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n",
      "    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n",
      "    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n",
      "    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n",
      "    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n",
      "    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n",
      "    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n",
      "    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n",
      "    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n",
      "    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n",
      "    most of the corrosion occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n",
      "    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n",
      "    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n",
      "    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n",
      "    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n",
      "    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n",
      "    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n",
      "    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n",
      "    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n",
      "    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n",
      "    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n",
      "    economics are questionable for street use.\n",
      "\n",
      "    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n",
      "    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n",
      "    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n",
      "    information at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n",
      "    more.  Is it worth it?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n",
      "    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n",
      "    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n",
      "    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n",
      "    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n",
      "    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n",
      "    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n",
      "    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n",
      "    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n",
      "    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n",
      "    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n",
      "    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n",
      "    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n",
      "    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n",
      "    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n",
      "\n",
      "    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n",
      "    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n",
      "    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n",
      "    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n",
      "    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n",
      "    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n",
      "    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n",
      "    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n",
      "    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n",
      "    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n",
      "    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n",
      "    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n",
      "    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n",
      "    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n",
      "    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n",
      "    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n",
      "    eventuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n",
      "    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n",
      "    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n",
      "    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n",
      "    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n",
      "    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n",
      "    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n",
      "    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n",
      "    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n",
      "    ABS system in your car.\n",
      "\n",
      "    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n",
      "    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n",
      "    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n",
      "    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n",
      "    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n",
      "    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n",
      "    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n",
      "    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n",
      "    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n",
      "    becomes very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  What about this threshold braking business?\n",

      "    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n",
      "    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n",
      "    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n",
      "    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n",
      "    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n",
      "    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n",
      "    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n",
      "    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n",
      "    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n",
      "    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n",
      "    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n",
      "    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n",
      "    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n",
      "    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n",
      "    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n",
      "    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n",
      "    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n",
      "    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n",
      "    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n",
      "    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n",
      "    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n",
      "    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n",
      "    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n",
      "    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n",

      "    How often should I change my oil?\n",
      "\n",

      "    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n",
      "    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n",

      "    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n",

      "    break.  What's the story?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n",
      "    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n",
      "    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n",
      "    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n",
      "    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n",
      "    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n",
      "    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n",
      "    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n",
      "    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n",
      "    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n",
      "    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n",
      "    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n",
      "    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n",
      "    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n",
      "    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n",
